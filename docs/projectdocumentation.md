## Multi-Agent Content Generation System  
### Kasparro — Applied AI Engineer Challenge

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Kasparro requires an automated **multi-agent content generation system** that can transform a small product JSON into the following structured outputs:

- FAQ Page  
- Product Description Page  
- Comparison Page (vs fictional Product B)

The system must output **clean, deterministic JSON** and must demonstrate:

- Proper agent boundaries  
- LangChain-based orchestration  
- Use of tools and structured schemas  
- JSON-only LLM responses  
- Reusable logic and prompt templates  

---

## 2. Solution Overview

The solution is built using a **true multi-agent architecture** powered by LangChain with Groq’s LLaMA-3.3-70B model.

The system uses **five specialized agents**, each implemented as a LangChain `StructuredTool`, orchestrated with `RunnableSequence`:

1. **Product Parsing Agent**  
2. **Question Generation Agent**  
3. **FAQ Agent**  
4. **Product Page Agent**  
5. **Comparison Agent**

Each agent has a distinct responsibility and communicates through structured JSON.

## 3. Scopes & Assumptions

### Scope
- Only JSON-based content generation is required.  
- Product B is fictional and generated by the LLM.  
- No external tools, databases, or scraping.  
- Must use LangChain (mandatory).  

### Assumptions
- Input product fields follow the expected schema.  
- Groq API key is available and valid.  
- LLM prompts consistently return well-formed JSON.

### 4.2 Agent Responsibilities

---

#### **1. ParseProductAgent**
- Validates required product fields  
- Normalizes lists  
- Converts price strings to integers  
- Outputs canonical product JSON  

---

#### **2. QuestionGenerationAgent**
- Generates **15 categorized questions**  
- Ensures structure:  


{ "questions": [{question, category}, ...] }

- Provides customer-oriented queries for FAQ generation  

---

#### **3. FAQAgent**
- Takes product + questions  
- Produces structured FAQ JSON:  
- question  
- answer  
- category  

---

#### **4. ProductPageAgent**
Produces a complete product description JSON:

- summary  
- key benefits  
- usage instructions  
- safety precautions  
- ingredient breakdown  
- price section  
- ideal skin types  

---

#### **5. ComparisonAgent**
- Invents fictional **Product B**  
- Compares A vs B on ingredients, benefits, concentration, price  
- Outputs structured comparison JSON  

---

## 4.3 Workflow Orchestration with RunnableSequence

The execution chain:



Step 1 → parse_product
Step 2 → generate_questions
Step 3 → build_faq
Step 4 → build_product_page
Step 5 → build_comparison


This ensures:

- Structured state passing (`ctx`)  
- Clean modular workflow  
- True agentic behavior (tool → model → tool → model)  
- Avoids static scripting  
- Reproducible multi-stage reasoning

# ✔ Why this version works

### This corrected version fixes:

| Problem in your diagram | Fix applied |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| GitHub Mermaid parser expected arrows but found random text | Removed all stray text & added clean closing ``` |
| Text placed on same line after code block | Added required blank lines |
| Agents not explicitly named → parser confusion | Added aliases like `Parser as ParseProductAgent` |
| Missing closing ```mermaid block | Properly closed |
