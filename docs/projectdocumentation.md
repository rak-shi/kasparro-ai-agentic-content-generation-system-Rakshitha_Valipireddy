## Multi-Agent Content Generation System  
### Kasparro — Applied AI Engineer Challenge

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Kasparro requires an automated **multi-agent content generation system** that can transform a small product JSON into the following structured outputs:

- FAQ Page  
- Product Description Page  
- Comparison Page (vs fictional Product B)

The system must output **clean, deterministic JSON** and must demonstrate:

- Proper agent boundaries  
- LangChain-based orchestration  
- Use of tools and structured schemas  
- JSON-only LLM responses  
- Reusable logic and prompt templates  

---

## 2. Solution Overview

The solution is built using a **true multi-agent architecture** powered by LangChain with Groq’s LLaMA-3.3-70B model.

The system uses **five specialized agents**, each implemented as a LangChain `StructuredTool`, orchestrated with `RunnableSequence`:

1. **Product Parsing Agent**  
2. **Question Generation Agent**  
3. **FAQ Agent**  
4. **Product Page Agent**  
5. **Comparison Agent**

Each agent has a distinct responsibility and communicates through structured JSON.

## 3. Scopes & Assumptions

### Scope
- Only JSON-based content generation is required.  
- Product B is fictional and generated by the LLM.  
- No external tools, databases, or scraping.  
- Must use LangChain (mandatory).  

### Assumptions
- Input product fields follow the expected schema.  
- Groq API key is available and valid.  
- LLM prompts consistently return well-formed JSON.
